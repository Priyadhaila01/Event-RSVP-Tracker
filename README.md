-Dragged RSVP Status and Attendance into Rows & Values to calculate counts

## Data Visualizations
-Created a pie chart for RSVP Status distribution
-Created a bar chart to compare Confirmed vs Attended

## Data Cleaning Steps
-Removed duplicate entries
-Standardized status values (e.g., “confirm” → “Confirmed”)
